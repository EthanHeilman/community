# Meeting Notes

## SSH3 Video Demo

* [Open PR in SSH3](https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3/pull/146): WIP. Some changes from SSH3 side need to go in prior to this PR being merged.

## OpenID Provider Chooser
* Specify OP at the command line isn't a great UX. Would be better to have a picker so that the user chooses in a GUI which OP to sign in with.

## Top 5 Projects
* Looking for input on what others would view at the top 5 TODOs. 
* Leave comments in the [issue](https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/issues/213)!

## Additional Use Cases
