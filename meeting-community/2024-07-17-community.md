# Meeting Notes

## Release 0.4.0

- PR for [release 0.4.0](https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/milestone/3) is up, which includes full support for SSH3. Blocked by some outstanding PRs on the SSH3 side, but OPK side is complete. Will merge once those dependencies are taken care of.
- Last thing to do is [documentation (WIP)](https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey/pull/209) around PK tokens and various types we support.

## August Community Meeting
